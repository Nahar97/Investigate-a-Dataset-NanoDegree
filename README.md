# Investigate-a-Dataset-NanoDegree
Project-2 Investigate a Dataset

Project Overview
In this project, I have analyzed a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. Here I used number of Python libraries such as-
1. NumPy
2. pandas 
3. Matplotlib.

What do I need to install? You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

1. pandas
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. csv

After completing the project, I have learned following :

Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code. Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently. Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process. Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
